CW(SA) is weight of SA at the start

N111 is the number of SA which take place in training, 
in invisible training, and in calibration sets
W% is ratio of N111/(number of all SA)
N110 is number of SA which take place in Training and invisible-Training
N101 is number of SA which take place in Training and calibration
N100 is number of SA which take place in Training (only)
